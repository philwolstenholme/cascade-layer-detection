          Browser support for <code>@supports at-rule(@layer)</code> isn't there
          yet, so we have no nice way to detect support for
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer"
            >CSS cascade layers</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a
          <a
            href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csstools/postcss-cascade-layers"
            >PostCSS polyfill</a
          >
          that rewrites your CSS to add selector complexity to match the
          behaviour of the layers, but what if we didn't want to send users of
          modern browsers the polyfilled CSS?
        </p>
        <p>
          This page uses Netlify edge functions to detect support for CSS
          cascade layers via HTTP rather than (just) CSS. You will initially be
          servered the polyfilled CSS, but if your browser supports CSS cascade
          layers, you will be served the unpolyfilled CSS on subsequent
          requests.
        </p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the build process, we generate <code>dist/styles.css</code> and a
            polyfilled version, <code>dist/styles-polyfilled.css</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            An edge function intercepts all requests to this page and checks for
            the presence of a cookie called
            <code>css-cascade-layer-support</code>
          </li>

          <li>
            If the cookie is not present:
            <ol>
              <li>
                A visually hidden HTML element
                <code
                  >&#x3C;span aria-hidden=&#x22;true&#x22;
                  data-css-cascade-layers-detector&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;</code
                >
                is added to the page
              </li>
              <li>
                We lazyload a CSS file called <code>dist/detect.css</code> that
                contains some unpolyfilled CSS inside a layer. Browsers that
                don't support CSS layers will ignore this. The CSS contains a
                background image for
                <code>[data-css-cascade-layers-detector]</code>
                that makes a HTTP request to an another edge function that
                returns a transparent image but also sets the
                <code>css-cascade-layer-support</code> cookie.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            If the cookie is present, we replace the <code>link</code> element
            that loads <code>dist/styles-polyfilled.css</code> with one that
            loads <code>dist/styles.css</code>, and the user gets a more simple
            CSS file
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Checking it's working</h2>
        <p>
          <span id="cascade-layer-output"></span>. Try inspecting the text below
          to see how the cascade is working.
        </p>
        <script>
          const support = document.cookie.includes(
            `css-cascade-layer-support=1`
          );

          if (support) {
            document.getElementById("cascade-layer-output").innerText =
              "You're using the non-polyfilled version";
          } else {
            document.getElementById("cascade-layer-output").innerText =
              "You're using the polyfilled version, but try reloading the page and see what happens";
          }
        </script>
        <p class="phils-wacky-styles--intro__text-lol font-georgia">
          This text should use the Georgia font, overriding the system font
          stack from the <code>pico</code> layer, the Comic Sans font from the
          <code>.phils-wacky-styles--intro__text-lol</code> selector in the
          <code>custom</code> layer, and instead applying the Georgia font stack
          from the <code>font-georgia</code> class in the
          <code>custom</code> layer.
