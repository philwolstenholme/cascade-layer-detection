          sound great for projects where CSS may be coming from multiple
          sources, and you want a nice way to manage the cascade. Unfortunately,
          there will still be users on older devices that don't have an
          up-to-date enough browser for cascade layers. Browsers that don't
          support cascade layers will <em>ignore</em> any CSS inside a layer, so
          these users might see a pretty broken site if you used layers
          extensively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, there is a
          <a
            href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@csstools/postcss-cascade-layers"
            >PostCSS polyfill</a
          >
          that rewrites your CSS to add selector complexity to match the
          behaviour of the layers, but what if we didn't want to send users of
          modern browsers the polyfilled CSS?

            <code>CSS.supports('at-rule(@layer)')</code> in JavaScript is not a
            thing</a

          yet, so we have no nice way to feature detect support for

          This page uses edge functions to detect support for CSS cascade layers
          via HTTP rather than (just) CSS. You will initially be served the
          polyfilled CSS, but if your browser supports CSS cascade layers, you
          will be served the unpolyfilled CSS on subsequent requests (e.g. if
          you reload the page).
        </p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the build process, we generate <code>dist/styles.css</code> and a
            polyfilled version, <code>dist/styles-polyfilled.css</code>. The
            source of our HTML file references the polyfilled version.
          </li>
          <li>
            An edge function intercepts all requests to this page and checks for
            the presence of a cookie called
            <code>css-cascade-layer-support</code>. You can

              >see the function's code here</a
            >.
          </li>

          <li>
            If the cookie is not present:
            <ol>
              <li>
                A visually hidden HTML element
                <code
                  >&#x3C;span aria-hidden=&#x22;true&#x22;
                  data-css-cascade-layers-detector&#x3E;&#x3C;/span&#x3E;</code
                >
                is added to the page
              </li>
              <li>
                We lazyload a CSS file called <code>dist/detect.css</code> that
                contains some unpolyfilled CSS inside a layer. Browsers that
                don't support CSS layers will ignore this. The CSS contains a
                background image for
                <code>[data-css-cascade-layers-detector]</code>
                that makes a HTTP request to an
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/philwolstenholme/cascade-layer-detection/blob/main/netlify/edge-functions/css-cascade-layers/index.ts"
                  >another edge function</a
                >
                that returns a transparent image but also sets the
                <code>css-cascade-layer-support</code> cookie.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            If the cookie is present, we replace the <code>link</code> element
            that loads <code>dist/styles-polyfilled.css</code> with one that
            loads <code>dist/styles.css</code>, and the user gets a more simple
            CSS file
          </li>
        </ol>

          This text should use the Georgia font, overriding the system font

          <code>.phils-wacky-styles--intro__text-lol</code> class in the
          <code>custom</code> layer, and instead applying the Georgia font stack
          from the <code>.font-georgia</code> class in the
          <code>utilities</code> layer.
